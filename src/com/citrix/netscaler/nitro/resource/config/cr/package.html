Cache redirection configuration. The cache redirection feature can transparently redirect cacheable HTTP requests to a cache and send non-cacheable or dynamic HTTP requests to the origin server. A cache stores or caches frequently requested web content and serves such web content to a client on behalf of the origin servers, alleviating the load on the origin server farm.
